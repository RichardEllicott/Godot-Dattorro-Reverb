# Godot Reverb

## What?

a simple wrapper for the excellent:
https://github.com/el-visio/dattorro-verb/tree/41e976a0228a2472156f5c010b3bfbb444e777d2

## Why?

unlike Godot's reverb based on freeverb, the diffusion of this reverb doesn't have the same resonant sound characteristic created by freeverb. El Visio's awesome repo is linked as a submodule

## Notes

tested on Godot Engine v4.4.1.stable and working, i'm still figuring out SCONS a bit, please let me know if you find anything bad or unusual (i think one issue i'm still working on is the template i forked creats Obj files everywhere)
